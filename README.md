# ANNTS (Artificial Neural Network Training System)

At some point in grade 11, I learned about Neural Networks.

### Goal

I built these ants with the goal of having a food-based training system that would **teach the ants to work together**, using each other's "ant blocks" to get past obstacles. I never got close to this goal though, since I accidentally spent about 100 hours on pixel art.

### Result

I now have an eight-frame animation sequence for the nine actions some nifty little pixel ants can perform. Also you can give the ants commands, but only in code. :)
